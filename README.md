# competitive-holiday
Welcome to competitive-holidaying.

The idea of this app is to allow users to eventually be able to compare their holidays in a more competitive manor. 

As the website stands, users are able to add new countires and cities that they've been to and include an image based on that country (that is hosted online)

Once a location is already created, you're able to edit them. The main editing feature i'd like users to utilise is the image. My image of what truly represents USA, or Maastricht might differ from another user. However in case of errors, names and maps can be updated. 

Users must log on to be able to utelise any features of the app beyond the home 

User Experience:

The user must log in. 

Once logged in, the user has multiple options;
- Create an Event (possible icebox)
- Create a Trip
- Create a City
- Create a Country 
- Create a Continent (limited to Admin)

order preference:
Continent
country
City
Events
Trip

Icebox - location to create all 3 tiers,

Once created, The use can build their trip.

the user can then click on the details page for a location or trip/Event

on this page it will allow you to edit/Delete
