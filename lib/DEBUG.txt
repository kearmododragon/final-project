- continents names coming through in admin/form as continent1
- csrf_token is showing on details page
- form not creating country
- country not rendering on page
- continents name instead of id (django URL parameters, str vs int)
- login seems to be broken, but sign up works (logs in) and admin portal works
- locations model doesn't show dates, due to default value?
